# Autocator
This repository contains the code files written to develop the Autocator web application.

## Overview of the Product

Everyone agrees that car breakdowns are highly unpredictable. We also agree that they are annoying. They occur at the most random times and at the most random places. Sometimes, you’re lucky enough to find a car mechanic to deal with the fault. Other times, you don’t and would have to end up leaving your car in a strange place. Nobody likes that. 

We identified this problem and came up with a solution — Autocator. Autocator is an app where car users can access car mechanics with different specializations, at the tap of a button. Welders, Vulcanizers, Electrical Wiring specialists, General Mechanics, and more!

To understand this problem better, we’ll conduct research to understand the pain points of our potential users and serve them better.

## Target Users of the Product

The target users of Autocator are grouped into two categories:

### Primary Target Users

- Car users.
- Car owners.
- Auto mechanics.
- Interested individuals

### Secondary Target Users

- Organizations (E.g. Ride-hailing companies like Uber)

More updates will be added as the product development is coming along.
